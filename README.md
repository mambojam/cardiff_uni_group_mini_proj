# cardiff_uni_group_mini_proj

This was a mini project set at the end of the first week of our MSc Computing course in the Computational Thinking Module

We had to draw inspration from some other websites and design something similar as a team

We looked at a few websites, identified styling aspects we liked, drew up  a wireframe and attmepted to recreate it

I'm now using this site to experiment myself with new techniques and improve on what we first created
